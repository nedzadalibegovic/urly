# Urly
A URL shortener built on the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack and using JSON
Web Tokens for authentication.

## I want to check it out!
Sure thing, go to [urly.nedzad.dev](https://urly.nedzad.dev/). Use `demo` as the username and `skafiskafnjak` as the password.

## Hey, I can't add links! What's up with that?
To prevent abuse, the only allowed domains are `github.com` and `medium.com` on the demo. Furthermore, 
every three hours the demo web app is purged.

## Can I make my own front end?
Heck yeah, you can! Head over to the `/server` subdirectory in this repository and 
make yourself familiar with the back end, the README.md should be useful to get you going.

You can also use the demo back end (urly.lyra.nedzad.dev) to experiment with API calls.
